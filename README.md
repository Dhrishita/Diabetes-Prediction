## Introduction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various health parameters using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, age, high BP, high cholestrol and more. The goal is to provide a tool that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and management of diabetes.

## Features

- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and scaling features.
- Implementation of various machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support vector machine, K-Nearest Neighbour and Logistic Regression).
- Model evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
- Easy to use and extend for other datasets or additional features.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dhrishita/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Once the chatbot is running, you can interact with it via the command line or a web interface. Simply type your questions or statements and the chatbot will respond accordingly.

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the data/ directory.
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
3. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
4. Use the model to make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
